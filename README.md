Module 6 Challenge - Python API Challenge
In the starter code files the WeatherPy-Copy1.ipynb and VacationPy-Copy1.ipynb files contain the jupyter notebook files where I did all of my work. The other original versions of the starter code are also present in this file but should be ignored. 
In the output data folder the original figures which were present when downloading the starter code are here, but the figures I made for the WeatherPy part of the assignment have my name in the file name. The CSV output also has my name in the file name to differentiate it from the file that comes with the starter code. As a side note I accidentally overwrote the cities.csv file that comes with the starter code so it is not the same as the original.
